## Idaho Software Collective (ISC) 🏔️
Hi there! Welcome to the Idaho Software Collective. We are a community of tech enthusiasts, developers, and creative problem-solvers primarily based in the Gem State—though our digital doors are open to everyone, regardless of geography.
Our mission is simple: to provide a space where hobbyists can sharpen their technical skills, collaborate on meaningful open-source projects, and have a grand old time doing it!
- A Note on Our Vibe: We are a "hobbyist-first" organization. Things might feel a little chaotic, especially as we find our footing, but that’s part of the fun. We prioritize a satisfying, low-pressure environment where curiosity leads the way.

## 🤝 Collective Organization
While we love the freedom of a collective, a little bit of structure helps us build a solid foundation. These roles help us coordinate our efforts and ensure everyone has a place to contribute.
| Title | Your Mission |
|---|---|
| General Contributor | The heartbeat of the ISC. You write code, fix bugs, and improve documentation. |
| Quality Advocate (Tester) | The final line of defense. You help break things so we can make them better. |
| AoI Commission | Strategic thinkers who help coordinate growth and vision within a specific Area of Interest. |
| Project Lead | Focused builders dedicated to designing, growing, and publishing products within a specific team. |

## 💡 Areas of Interest (AoIs)
To keep our creativity focused, we organize projects into thematic buckets. This makes it easier for you to find a project that aligns with your personal passions.
- 🦌 Wildlife & Environment
  - Fish Hatchery Dashboard: A flagship project designed to track hatchery production data (feed, water flows, population counts). The goal is to automate compliance reporting and give hatchery managers their time back.
- 💻 Technology & Tools
  - Seeking ideas! This area is for developer tools, CLI utilities, or anything that makes the "act of building" easier for others.
- 🌿 Lifestyle & Wellness
  - The Intentional Planner: More than just a to-do list—this project aims to help users map out long-term dreams and break them down into actionable daily tasks.
- 🎓 Education
 * Projects focused on EdTech, gamified learning, or resources for local Idaho students and teachers.
- Business
 * Permit Builder: A streamlined tool to help small business owners and contractors quickly organize and generate food and septic permit applications.
- 🛠️ Project Foundation
To keep our repository clean and navigable, every project follows a simple three-step structure:
  - Research: The "Why" and "How." Discovery notes and market research.
  - Technical Design: The blueprints. Architecture diagrams and logic flows.
  - Source Code: The "What." The living, breathing software.
## 📜 General Guidelines
- 🤖 Smart AI Usage: We embrace the future! AI is a powerful tool, and we encourage you to use it. However, because learning is our core value, we have one "Golden Rule":
  - Avoid the "Delete & Paste" method. Instead of replacing entire files with AI output, we ask that you surgically edit specific lines.
  - Why? This ensures you actually understand the logic being implemented and keeps our "git diffs" clean and readable for everyone else.
- 🧡 The Kindness Compact
We are all students here. We ask that every member treats others with patience and respect. There are no "stupid questions" in the ISC—only opportunities to teach and learn.
## 📣 Let’s Connect
As we grow, we plan to host Code Sprints, and Virtual Coffee Chats. Whether we are a tight-knit group of five or a bustling community of hundreds, we want this to be driven by you. If you have an idea for a meetup or a new project, don't be shy—step up and share it!
