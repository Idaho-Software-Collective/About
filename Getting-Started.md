# 🚀 Getting Started with ISC
Welcome to the collective! We’re thrilled to have you. Whether you are a seasoned engineer or just wrote your first "Hello World," this guide will help you get plugged into our workflow.
## 1. Join the Conversation
Before touching any code, come say hi! This is where we coordinate projects and share ideas.
 * Discord/Slack: [Launching Soon!]
 * Introduce Yourself: Tell us what you’re interested in (e.g., "I love trout and Python" or "I'm here to learn React").
## 2. Technical Prerequisites
Since we are a software collective, you’ll need a few "tools of the trade" installed on your machine:
 * Git: For version control. 
 * GitHub Account: Where our code lives.
 * A Code Editor: We recommend VS Code, but use whatever makes you happy!
## 3. Your First Contribution (The 5-Step Process)
We use a standard "Fork and Pull" workflow. Here is how to make your mark:
- Step A: Fork the Repository
  - Navigate to the project you’re interested in (like the hatchery-dashboard) and click the Fork button. This creates your own personal copy of the code to play with.
- Step B: Clone & Branch
  - Open your terminal and run:

'''
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/project-name.git
cd project-name
git checkout -b feature/your-awesome-idea 
'''

*Tip*: Always create a new "branch" for your work so the main code stays clean!
- Step C: The "Smart AI" Coding
Write your code! Remember our AI Policy:
  - 🤖 Reminder: If you use AI, please edit specific lines rather than pasting whole files. It helps us all learn and keeps our history readable!
- Step D: Commit & Push
When you're happy with your changes:
'''
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of what you did"
git push origin feature/your-awesome-idea
'''

- Step E: Open a Pull Request (PR)
Go to the original ISC repository on GitHub. You’ll see a button to "Compare & pull request." Submit it, and a member of the AoI Project Team will review it, give some friendly feedback, and merge it in!
## 📂 Exploring the Folders
When you open one of our project folders, you'll usually see this:
 * /research: Documentation on why we are building this and who it's for.
 * /design: Wireframes, database schemas, or logic flowcharts.
 * /src: The actual source code.
## 🆘 Need Help?
Getting stuck is part of the hobby! If you hit a wall:
 * Check the Issues tab: Someone else might have had the same problem.
 * Ask in the Chat: Post a screenshot of your error in the #help-me channel.
 * Be Patient: We’re all volunteers, but we’ll get back to you as soon as we can.
Would you like me to help you create a "Project Proposal Template" so members know how to suggest new ideas for the Technology or Education categories?
