🚀 How We Move from Proposal to Project
To help you visualize how your idea becomes code, here is the typical lifecycle of an ISC project:
 * Proposal: You submit this template.
 * Review: The AoI Commission looks it over and gives a "Thumbs Up" or asks clarifying questions.
 * Research & Design: A small team creates the /research and /design documents.
 * Development: The coding begins in the /src folder!
 * Launch: We celebrate a "Version 1.0" and share it with the collective.
