🐟 Project: Fish Hatchery Dashboard
Issue #1: Research - Local Hatchery Directory
 * Difficulty: Beginner (Non-coding)
 * The Task: We need a comprehensive list of Idaho-based fish hatcheries (state, federal, and private) to use as our "customer" personas.
 * Deliverable: Create a Markdown file in /research/hatcheries.md listing the name, location, and types of fish raised at at least 10 Idaho hatcheries.
 * Why it matters: This helps us understand who will actually use the dashboard.
Issue #2: Design - Feed Conversion Formula Docs
 * Difficulty: Intermediate (Math/Logic)
 * The Task: Research and document the standard formulas for "Feed Conversion Ratio" (FCR) used in aquaculture.
 * Deliverable: Add a section to /design/logic.md explaining the math. Use LaTeX if possible, e.g., FCR = \frac{\text{Total Feed Fed}}{\text{Weight Gained}}.
 * Why it matters: Our developers need the math before they can write the code.
Issue #3: Frontend - Dashboard "Mockup" (HTML/CSS)
 * Difficulty: Beginner/Intermediate (Coding)
 * The Task: Create a simple, static HTML page that shows what a "Hatchery Overview" might look like. Include placeholders for "Water Temperature," "Oxygen Levels," and "Current Biomass."
 * Deliverable: A single index.html file in /src/ui-prototype.
 * Why it matters: It gives the team something visual to get excited about!
